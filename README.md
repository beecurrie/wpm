# Web-based Password Manager (WPM)

Web-based application for managing passwords

Application created using the **MERN** Stack.

The app have the following functionalities:

1. User Registration – every user of the system will need to register into the application.
   Minimal information will be asked during registration. This will include the following:
   a. Email address – this will be verified by the system if this is a valid email
   b. Full name of the user
   c. Mobile phone
2. Login – user will be required to login to access his/her account. User will be required to enter
   a strong password during the registration phase. This is to safeguard access to the database of
   passwords of the user.
3. Two (2) Factor Authentication – User will be required to supply a second method to
   authenticate into the system
4. Account Recovery – The system will have a facility to recover account in case a user forgets
   his/her password. The recovery method should be robust enough not to allow hackers exploit
   this feature.
5. Strong Password Suggestion – The system will have a facility to suggest a strong login
   password for the user.
6. Display of Passwords – Once the user is authenticated by the system, a dashboard will be
   displayed containing the list of stored passwords. There will be a button to display password
   in plain text. Initial display of passwords will be masked with asterisks (\*).
